# Complete SQL Guide: From Stored Procedures to Advanced Techniques

## Part I: MySQL Stored Procedures â€“ Beginner Guide

### What is a Stored Procedure?
A **stored procedure** in MySQL is like a *saved set of SQL steps* in the database. Instead of typing the same query every time, you **store it once** and **call it whenever you need it**.

### Basic Stored Procedure Examples

#### 1. Show All Customers
```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE ShowAllCustomers()
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM customer_info;
END$$
DELIMITER ;
```
**Run it:**
```sql
CALL ShowAllCustomers();
```
ðŸ“Œ *This simply lists all customers from the `customer_info` table.*

#### 2. Find Customer by ID (Using Input Parameter)
```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE GetCustomerByID(IN CustID INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM customer_info WHERE customer_id = CustID;
END$$
DELIMITER ;
```
**Run it:**
```sql
CALL GetCustomerByID(1);
```
ðŸ“Œ *This shows details for the customer whose ID is `1`.*

#### 3. Show Sales for a Customer
```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE GetSalesByCustomer(IN CustID INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT s.sales_id, s.total_sales, p.product_name 
    FROM sales s 
    JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id 
    WHERE s.customer_id = CustID;
END$$
DELIMITER ;
```
**Run it:**
```sql
CALL GetSalesByCustomer(2);
```
ðŸ“Œ *This shows all sales made by customer `2`.*

#### 4. Add a New Customer
```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE AddCustomer(IN Name VARCHAR(120), IN Location VARCHAR(90))
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO customer_info(full_name, location) 
    VALUES(Name, Location);
END$$
DELIMITER ;
```
**Run it:**
```sql
CALL AddCustomer('John Doe', 'Nairobi');
```
ðŸ“Œ *This inserts a new customer into the database.*

### Advanced Stored Procedure Examples

#### 5. Procedure with Output Parameter
```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE GetCustomerCount(OUT TotalCustomers INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO TotalCustomers FROM customer_info;
END$$
DELIMITER ;
```
**Run it:**
```sql
CALL GetCustomerCount(@total);
SELECT @total AS 'Total Customers';
```

#### 6. Procedure with Conditional Logic
```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE UpdateCustomerStatus(IN CustID INT, IN NewStatus VARCHAR(20))
BEGIN
    DECLARE customer_exists INT DEFAULT 0;
    
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO customer_exists 
    FROM customer_info 
    WHERE customer_id = CustID;
    
    IF customer_exists > 0 THEN
        UPDATE customer_info 
        SET status = NewStatus 
        WHERE customer_id = CustID;
        SELECT 'Customer status updated successfully' AS Result;
    ELSE
        SELECT 'Customer not found' AS Result;
    END IF;
END$$
DELIMITER ;
```

### Key Notes for Beginners
- `DELIMITER $$` â†’ Tells MySQL we are writing a block of code until we say `$$`
- `IN` â†’ Means the procedure expects an input value
- `OUT` â†’ Means the procedure returns a value
- `CALL` â†’ Runs the stored procedure

**Primary use cases:**
1. **View** data easily
2. **Filter** data based on a value
3. **Insert** new data
4. **Join** tables without rewriting big queries

## Part II: Advanced SQL Techniques

## 1. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

### Definition
A **CTE (Common Table Expression)** is a temporary named result set used to simplify complex queries, especially those with subqueries.

### Syntax
```sql
WITH cte_name (optional_column_names) AS (
    SELECT ...
    FROM ...
    WHERE ...
)
SELECT * FROM cte_name;
```

### Benefits
- Simplifies nested queries
- Improves readability and reusability
- Can be recursive
- Better performance than subqueries in some cases
- Allows for modular query construction

### Examples

#### Example 1: Students Scoring Above 85
```sql
WITH TopStudents AS (
    SELECT name, score FROM students WHERE score > 85
)
SELECT * FROM TopStudents ORDER BY score DESC;
```

#### Example 2: High Earners
```sql
WITH HighEarners AS (
    SELECT name, salary FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000
)
SELECT * FROM HighEarners ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

#### Example 3: Average Salary by Department
```sql
WITH AvgDeptSalary AS (
    SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
)
SELECT d.department_name, ads.avg_salary
FROM AvgDeptSalary ads
JOIN departments d ON ads.department_id = d.department_id;
```

### Recursive CTEs
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE employee_hierarchy AS (
    -- Base case: top-level managers
    SELECT employee_id, name, manager_id, 1 as level
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Recursive case: employees reporting to previous level
    SELECT e.employee_id, e.name, e.manager_id, eh.level + 1
    FROM employees e
    JOIN employee_hierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.employee_id
)
SELECT * FROM employee_hierarchy ORDER BY level, name;
```

### Multiple CTEs
```sql
WITH 
high_performers AS (
    SELECT employee_id, name, performance_score
    FROM employees
    WHERE performance_score > 4.5
),
recent_hires AS (
    SELECT employee_id, name, hire_date
    FROM employees
    WHERE hire_date > '2023-01-01'
)
SELECT hp.name, hp.performance_score, rh.hire_date
FROM high_performers hp
JOIN recent_hires rh ON hp.employee_id = rh.employee_id;
```

### CTE in Stored Procedures
```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE GetTopPerformers(IN MinScore DECIMAL(3,2))
BEGIN
    WITH TopEmployees AS (
        SELECT employee_id, name, performance_score, department
        FROM employees
        WHERE performance_score >= MinScore
    )
    SELECT * FROM TopEmployees ORDER BY performance_score DESC;
END$$
DELIMITER ;
```

## 2. Window Functions

### Definition
Window functions perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row, without grouping the result set.

### Syntax
```sql
function_name() OVER (
    [PARTITION BY column1, column2, ...]
    [ORDER BY column1, column2, ...]
    [ROWS/RANGE BETWEEN ... AND ...]
)
```

### Types of Window Functions

#### Ranking Functions
```sql
-- ROW_NUMBER(): Assigns unique sequential integers
SELECT name, salary,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as row_num
FROM employees;

-- RANK(): Assigns ranks with gaps for ties
SELECT name, salary,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as rank
FROM employees;

-- DENSE_RANK(): Assigns ranks without gaps
SELECT name, salary,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as dense_rank
FROM employees;

-- NTILE(): Divides rows into specified number of groups
SELECT name, salary,
       NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as quartile
FROM employees;
```

#### Aggregate Window Functions
```sql
-- Running totals
SELECT order_date, amount,
       SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) as running_total
FROM orders;

-- Moving averages
SELECT order_date, amount,
       AVG(amount) OVER (
           ORDER BY order_date 
           ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
       ) as moving_avg_3_days
FROM orders;

-- Percentage of total
SELECT department, salary,
       salary / SUM(salary) OVER () * 100 as pct_of_total
FROM employees;
```

#### Value Functions
```sql
-- LAG/LEAD: Access previous/next row values
SELECT order_date, amount,
       LAG(amount, 1) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) as prev_amount,
       LEAD(amount, 1) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) as next_amount
FROM orders;

-- FIRST_VALUE/LAST_VALUE: First/last value in window
SELECT name, salary, department,
       FIRST_VALUE(name) OVER (
           PARTITION BY department 
           ORDER BY salary DESC
       ) as highest_paid_in_dept
FROM employees;
```

### Window Functions in Stored Procedures
```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE GetSalesRanking(IN DeptName VARCHAR(50))
BEGIN
    SELECT 
        name,
        sales_amount,
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY sales_amount DESC) as sales_rank,
        NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY sales_amount DESC) as quartile
    FROM employees
    WHERE department = DeptName;
END$$
DELIMITER ;
```

## 3. Advanced Joins

### Self Joins
```sql
-- Find employees and their managers
SELECT e1.name AS employee, e2.name AS manager
FROM employees e1
LEFT JOIN employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id;
```

### Cross Joins
```sql
-- Generate all possible combinations
SELECT p.product_name, c.category_name
FROM products p
CROSS JOIN categories c;
```

### Lateral Joins (PostgreSQL, SQL Server)
```sql
-- Get top 3 orders for each customer
SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_date, o.amount
FROM customers c
CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT order_date, amount
    FROM orders
    WHERE customer_id = c.customer_id
    ORDER BY order_date DESC
    LIMIT 3
) o;
```

## 4. Subqueries and Correlated Subqueries

### Scalar Subqueries
```sql
-- Employee with highest salary
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary = (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);
```

### Correlated Subqueries
```sql
-- Employees earning above department average
SELECT name, salary, department_id
FROM employees e1
WHERE salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary)
    FROM employees e2
    WHERE e2.department_id = e1.department_id
);
```

### EXISTS and NOT EXISTS
```sql
-- Customers with at least one order
SELECT customer_name
FROM customers c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM orders o WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
);

-- Products never ordered
SELECT product_name
FROM products p
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM order_items oi WHERE oi.product_id = p.product_id
);
```

### Subqueries in Stored Procedures
```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE GetAboveAverageEmployees(IN DeptID INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT name, salary
    FROM employees e1
    WHERE department_id = DeptID
    AND salary > (
        SELECT AVG(salary)
        FROM employees e2
        WHERE e2.department_id = DeptID
    );
END$$
DELIMITER ;
```

## 5. Advanced Aggregation

### GROUPING SETS
```sql
-- Multiple grouping levels in one query
SELECT department, job_title, COUNT(*) as employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (
    (department),
    (job_title),
    (department, job_title),
    ()  -- Grand total
);
```

### ROLLUP
```sql
-- Hierarchical totals
SELECT department, job_title, COUNT(*) as employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY ROLLUP (department, job_title);
```

### CUBE
```sql
-- All possible combinations of grouping columns
SELECT department, job_title, COUNT(*) as employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY CUBE (department, job_title);
```

### FILTER Clause
```sql
-- Conditional aggregation
SELECT department,
       COUNT(*) as total_employees,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE salary > 50000) as high_earners,
       AVG(salary) FILTER (WHERE hire_date > '2020-01-01') as avg_salary_recent_hires
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

## 6. String Functions and Pattern Matching

### Advanced String Functions
```sql
-- String manipulation
SELECT 
    CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) as full_name,
    SUBSTRING(email, 1, POSITION('@' IN email) - 1) as username,
    REGEXP_REPLACE(phone, '[^0-9]', '', 'g') as clean_phone
FROM users;
```

### Regular Expressions
```sql
-- PostgreSQL regex examples
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE product_name ~ '^[A-Z][a-z]+ \d+$';  -- Starts with capital, ends with number

-- Extract patterns
SELECT 
    product_code,
    SUBSTRING(product_code FROM '[A-Z]{2,3}') as category_code,
    SUBSTRING(product_code FROM '\d+') as product_number
FROM products;
```

### String Functions in Stored Procedures
```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE CleanPhoneNumbers()
BEGIN
    UPDATE customers 
    SET phone = REGEXP_REPLACE(phone, '[^0-9]', '');
    
    SELECT COUNT(*) as 'Cleaned Records' FROM customers;
END$$
DELIMITER ;
```

## 7. Date and Time Functions

### Date Arithmetic
```sql
-- Date calculations
SELECT 
    order_date,
    DATE_ADD(order_date, INTERVAL 30 DAY) as due_date,
    DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, order_date) as days_since_order,
    DAYOFWEEK(order_date) as day_of_week,
    DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m') as order_month
FROM orders;
```

### Time Series Analysis
```sql
-- Generate date series (MySQL 8.0+ with recursive CTE)
WITH RECURSIVE date_series AS (
    SELECT '2023-01-01' as date
    UNION ALL
    SELECT DATE_ADD(date, INTERVAL 1 DAY)
    FROM date_series
    WHERE date < '2023-12-31'
)
SELECT 
    ds.date,
    COALESCE(SUM(o.amount), 0) as daily_sales
FROM date_series ds
LEFT JOIN orders o ON ds.date = DATE(o.order_date)
GROUP BY ds.date
ORDER BY ds.date;
```

## 8. JSON Operations (MySQL 5.7+)

### JSON Functions
```sql
-- Working with JSON data
SELECT 
    user_id,
    JSON_EXTRACT(preferences, '$.theme') as theme_preference,
    JSON_LENGTH(JSON_EXTRACT(preferences, '$.notifications')) as notification_count,
    JSON_EXTRACT(profile, '$.address.city') as city
FROM users
WHERE JSON_EXTRACT(preferences, '$.language') = 'en';

-- JSON aggregation
SELECT 
    department,
    JSON_ARRAYAGG(
        JSON_OBJECT(
            'name', name,
            'salary', salary,
            'hire_date', hire_date
        )
    ) as employees_json
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

### JSON in Stored Procedures
```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE GetUserPreferences(IN UserID INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT 
        user_id,
        JSON_PRETTY(preferences) as formatted_preferences
    FROM users
    WHERE user_id = UserID;
END$$
DELIMITER ;
```

## 9. Combining Techniques: Advanced Stored Procedures

### Comprehensive Sales Report Procedure
```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE GenerateSalesReport(
    IN StartDate DATE,
    IN EndDate DATE,
    IN DepartmentFilter VARCHAR(50)
)
BEGIN
    -- Declare variables
    DECLARE total_sales DECIMAL(15,2) DEFAULT 0;
    DECLARE avg_sale DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0;
    
    -- Main report with multiple advanced techniques
    WITH 
    sales_data AS (
        SELECT 
            e.department,
            e.name as employee_name,
            s.sale_date,
            s.amount,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY e.department ORDER BY s.amount DESC) as dept_rank
        FROM sales s
        JOIN employees e ON s.employee_id = e.employee_id
        WHERE s.sale_date BETWEEN StartDate AND EndDate
        AND (DepartmentFilter IS NULL OR e.department = DepartmentFilter)
    ),
    department_totals AS (
        SELECT 
            department,
            SUM(amount) as dept_total,
            AVG(amount) as dept_avg,
            COUNT(*) as sale_count
        FROM sales_data
        GROUP BY department
    )
    SELECT 
        sd.department,
        sd.employee_name,
        sd.amount,
        sd.dept_rank,
        dt.dept_total,
        dt.dept_avg,
        ROUND((sd.amount / dt.dept_total) * 100, 2) as pct_of_dept_sales
    FROM sales_data sd
    JOIN department_totals dt ON sd.department = dt.department
    ORDER BY sd.department, sd.dept_rank;
    
    -- Summary statistics
    SELECT 
        SUM(amount) INTO total_sales
    FROM sales s
    JOIN employees e ON s.employee_id = e.employee_id
    WHERE s.sale_date BETWEEN StartDate AND EndDate
    AND (DepartmentFilter IS NULL OR e.department = DepartmentFilter);
    
    SELECT CONCAT('Total Sales: $', FORMAT(total_sales, 2)) as Summary;
    
END$$
DELIMITER ;
```

### Dynamic Query Building Procedure
```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE DynamicEmployeeSearch(
    IN SearchName VARCHAR(100),
    IN MinSalary DECIMAL(10,2),
    IN Department VARCHAR(50),
    IN SortBy VARCHAR(20)
)
BEGIN
    SET @sql = 'SELECT employee_id, name, salary, department, hire_date FROM employees WHERE 1=1';
    
    IF SearchName IS NOT NULL THEN
        SET @sql = CONCAT(@sql, ' AND name LIKE ''%', SearchName, '%''');
    END IF;
    
    IF MinSalary IS NOT NULL THEN
        SET @sql = CONCAT(@sql, ' AND salary >= ', MinSalary);
    END IF;
    
    IF Department IS NOT NULL THEN
        SET @sql = CONCAT(@sql, ' AND department = ''', Department, '''');
    END IF;
    
    CASE SortBy
        WHEN 'name' THEN SET @sql = CONCAT(@sql, ' ORDER BY name');
        WHEN 'salary' THEN SET @sql = CONCAT(@sql, ' ORDER BY salary DESC');
        WHEN 'hire_date' THEN SET @sql = CONCAT(@sql, ' ORDER BY hire_date DESC');
        ELSE SET @sql = CONCAT(@sql, ' ORDER BY employee_id');
    END CASE;
    
    PREPARE stmt FROM @sql;
    EXECUTE stmt;
    DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;
END$$
DELIMITER ;
```
